I put additional ideas that I had in this folder that I thought about implementing but decided not to.
I also outline how I approached the challenge.

Steps taken to complete challenge:

- Read through spec
- Research unknowns from spec (e.g. ISO speeds)
- Clarify unknnows from spec with client (e.g. "reverse" order, initially I thought I would need to ask, but after seeing the folder's initial file structure sorted, I understood I was supposed flip the order)
- Identify requirements (e.g. Download zip, extract zip, etc...)
- Implement requirements
